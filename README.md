# M5Stack_Thermostat
Thermostat Heat only for the M5Stack This uses the M5 Stack IOT relay add on and the ENV sensor. Update the SSID and Passowrd. 
If you are using a Phillips Hue system and want to turn things on with the heat like fans, then update your API key, otherwise
remove the call to turn on the fan. A call also exists for a basic sonoff device. Set the timeserver to something you are 
allowed to poll every minute. Also set the logging server you would like to log to. Then download your code to the M5Stack.
